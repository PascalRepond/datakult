Neil Gaiman weaves mythology, literature, and philosophy into a *breathtaking* narrative about Dream and the Endless. The series moves effortlessly between horror, fantasy, and drama, creating something truly unique. Every arc is memorable, but *Season of Mists* and *The Kindly Ones* are particularly **outstanding**.",
